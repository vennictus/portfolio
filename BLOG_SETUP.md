# Blog Setup Checklist

## ✅ What's Done:

1. ✅ Created MDX file: `src/data/blogs/history-of-codeing.mdx`
2. ✅ Created image folder: `public/images/history-of-codeing/`
3. ✅ Added proper frontmatter with metadata
4. ✅ Structured all content with headings
5. ✅ Added image placeholders in the content

## 📋 What You Need to Do:

### Step 1: Add Images
Copy your images from Hashnode to:
```
public/images/history-of-codeing/
```

Required images:
- `title.jpg` (featured image)
- `punch-cards.jpg`
- `punch-card-detail.jpg`
- `eniac.jpg`
- `rope-memory.jpg`

See `public/images/history-of-codeing/README.md` for details.

### Step 2: Test the Blog
Run the dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit:
- Homepage: http://localhost:3000 (should show in blog preview)
- Blog page: http://localhost:3000/blog
- Your post: http://localhost:3000/blog/history-of-codeing

### Step 3: (Optional) Adjust Images
If you don't have all 5 images, you can:
- Remove the image markdown lines from the MDX file
- Or generate placeholder images (I can help with this)

## 🎨 Image Tips:

- The site automatically applies grayscale filter
- Images show color on hover (cool effect!)
- Landscape orientation works best
- Minimum 1200px width recommended

## 🚀 Next Steps:

Once this blog is working, we can:
1. Update the other 3 placeholder blogs
2. Add more of your Hashnode content
3. Update the projects section
