In reality, you can't have a computer without coding... and you can't have coding without a computer... right?\n\nWell, that's where we can safely burst this bubble and come to a conclusion: coding predates computers, and that too by a long shot.\n\nIt began in the 1800s with the textile industry.\n\nAnd how?\n\nPunch cards.\n\nThey told the machine where to put the thread. Literally - see this hole, put in the thread. It was the first instance of making a machine bend to your will.\n\nThe control we so crave over machines was born here.\n\n**1801 - The Jacquard Loom:** Joseph Marie Jacquard uses punch cards to automate fabric patterns. This is the first time \"data\" (holes in paper) tells a machine what to do.\n\nThe great binary logic is born.\n\n## the first leetcoder\n\nThen in 1842 came Ada Lovelace, who, building on Charles Babbage's designs for the Analytical Engine - a machine he claimed could perform complex computations - wrote what is now considered the first algorithm intended for a machine, and possibly the first DSA algorithm??????\n\nAlthough the computer itself was never built in her lifetime, the title of the world's first programmer was bestowed upon her (leetcoder too).\n\nBefore machines existed, the idea of instructing them already did.\n\n## how holes became logic\n\nWe typically count using the decimal or base 10 system of ten digits.\n\nWhen we run out of digits, we repeat with a prefix, which I assume everyone knows already (I hope).\n\n0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12…. see.\n\nBut we also know 0 and 1 is where it's at, and literally everything is 0 and 1… the beloved cat memes we so love are 0 and 1 too.\n\nNow, people whose attention spans are cooked might have already put 2 and 2 together and figured out how a punch card works, but for others like me still wondering, here it is.\n\nThink of them like OMR sheets we used to give in an exam.\n\nYou have a question where the correct answer is option C. What do you do?\n\nYou scribble your way into the 3rd hole marked C. Then the computer reads it using a scanner, detects light passing through the other options, but not through C, and marks your answer.\n\n+4 marks awarded. Or -1 if you're giving the exam with my luck.\n\nNow imagine each question is an index - 1, 2, 3 - and the options are numbers, alphabets, or symbols. Our beloved fundamental characters.\n\n![Punch cards used in early computing](/images/history-of-codeing/punch-card.jpg)\n\nYou punch out the hole of the character you want and feed it into the machine.\n\nThe machine runs electrodes through each hole, each index, and if current passes through because paper isn't blocking it, that's a 1. If it doesn't, that's a 0.\n\ncheck them out and play with them here - [http://kloth.net/services/cardpunch.php](http://kloth.net/services/cardpunch.php)\n\nInformation had now become physical.\n\n## the man whose work made the pad think\n\nThen came along Herman Hollerith.\n\nYou might not know him, but you definitely know his banger of an invention - IBM. (ThinkPad reach farmers... yeah, this is the guy you thank.)\n\nHe developed a tabulating machine that used punch cards for instructions, and technically, the coding we know today was born.\n\nThis machine was used for the United States census. You could not only calculate people but also sort them.\n\nSorting - as we know it - was born here. (yeah f u bubble sort)\n\nFor the first time, machines didn't just follow instructions. They processed information, which paved the way for the processors we know today.\n\n## the intercontinental machine war\n\nThen came the 1940s, when the world was locked into one brutal focus: World War II.\n\nAt the peak of the conflict, both sides raced for smarter weapons and even smarter machines. Necessity pushed innovation into overdrive.\n\nThis time, the Germans reached the milestone first.\n\nIn 1941, they unveiled the Z3 computer - the first fully functional, automatic, programmable digital computer. It handled complex engineering calculations humans simply couldn't keep up with anymoreâ€¦ this became the backbone of the German air force, performing their calculations for them.\n\nMachines were no longer assisting thought. They were replacing human limitation.\n\nAnd then, freedom fights back.\n\nIn 1944, we get the American Harvard Mark I - a 50-foot electromechanical giant running on paper tape instructions and relentless precision. It could execute long automatic calculations without human intervention.\n\nExperimental computing had now entered practical reality.\n\nThen came 1945 and ENIAC - the first truly general-purpose electronic computer.\n\nFast for its time. Brutal to operate.\n\nProgramming meant physically rewiring cables and flipping switches like a giant telephone exchange.\n\nNo screen. No keyboard. Just logic, patience, and a whole lot of sweat.\n\n![ENIAC computer](/images/history-of-codeing/eniac.png)\n\n## assemblyâ€¦.assemble\n\nBefore the programming languages we know today and love so dearly were born, there was the Assembly era.\n\nAs computers in the late 1940s grew more complex, writing raw machine code became unbearable.\n\nEngineers made mistakes. Debugging was painful. Programs took forever to build.\n\nSo they created a symbolic layer over machine instructions â€” Assembly Language (yeah, the one I'm still scared of).\n\nInstead of:\n\n```\n10110000 01100001\n```\n\nYou could write:\n\n```assembly\nMOV A, 97\n```\n\nSame instructions, but now way less suffering. I can't imagine what pre-assembly suffering was if assembly itself was considered a relief.\n\nEarly assemblers began appearing in the 1950s. This marked the shift from hardware wrestling to actual software thinking.\n\nBut Assembly was brutal in its own way:\n\n- Every processor had a unique instruction set\n- Zero portability\n- Optimization was manual\n- Memory was microscopic\n- One wrong opcode = crash city\n\nWriting Assembly wasn't programming, but more of a negotiation with the hardware.\n\nThis mindset peaked with the Apollo Guidance Computer. Code wasn't stored digitally - it was physically woven into memory by hand. aka rope memory.\n\n![Apollo rope memory](/images/history-of-codeing/rope-memory.png)\n\nEngineers wrote Assembly. Factory workers threaded wires through magnetic cores to represent bits.\n\nA single mistake could put a moon mission at risk.\n\nNo patches. No updates. No Version Control. No Ctrl+Z.\n\nThis era forced programmers to think like the machine:\n\n- Memory cycles mattered\n- Instruction counts mattered\n- Power consumption mattered\n- Timing errors could be fatal\n\nAssembly was the last era where programmers truly understood every electron their code touched.\n\nTry telling this to the matcha-drinking, MacBook-using, Cursor user vibe-coding their way through problems.\n\n## if it ain't broke, don't fix it\n\nThen in 1954 came the big leap.\n\nAt IBM, the invention of FORTRAN (Formula Translation) changed everything. For the first time, humans could write instructions closer to math than machine code and let the compiler handle the ugly translation.\n\nIt quietly became the foundation for how modern languages think about structure and abstraction.\n\nAnd in true developer fashion - if it ain't broke, don't fix it - FORTRAN is still in use today.\n\nThen in 1959 came COBOL, designed for business, finance, and administration. While FORTRAN ruled scientific computing, COBOL became the language that ran governments, banks, and massive institutions - and honestly, still does in more places than people like to admit. Your ATM probably runs on machine logic influenced by code written decades ago.\n\n## the breaking point\n\nBy the late 60s, hardware was getting faster, but software was collapsing under its own weight.\n\nProjects ran years late. Budgets exploded. Code became spaghetti logic where fixing one bug created ten more. (kinda sounds like my code)\n\nThis was the Software Crisis.\n\nComputers had become too complex for humans to manage using just Assembly.\n\nWe needed something higher level - a language readable enough for humans, but precise enough for machines.\n\nSomething we could dictate without babysitting, something we could rely upon, and something we could run on every machine without breaking them - which, in case you didn't know, we couldn't do with Assemblyâ€¦ as it was, and still remains, hardware-specific.\n\n## the modern programming C's the light\n\nIn the midst of this crisis, at Bell Labs, Dennis Ritchie created C (my goat).\n\nC was the Goldilocks language. High-level enough to be readable. Low-level enough to talk directly to hardware. Most importantly, it was portable.\n\nFor the first time, you could write code once and run it on different types of computers.\n\nRitchie and Ken Thompson then did something legendary.\n\nThey used C to rewrite the Unix operating system.\n\nBefore Unix, operating systems were clunky and tied to specific machines. Unix was modular, stable, and adaptable. Because C made Unix portable, it spread rapidly through universities and research labs.\n\nThis wasn't just another tool.\n\nThis was the moment software became independent of hardware.\n\nEvery Mac, every Linux server, every Android phone today traces lineage back to this shift.\n\nThe way you write code now - abstracted, portable, layered - exists because we once had to punch holes in paper just to make a machine listen.\n\nAnd that's the story of how control turned into language - and language turned into code.\n\n## for those looking for more\n\ncheck this video out - [The History of Computing](https://youtu.be/M4d3FXu9-3I)\n\nwikipedia is also really helpful - [Computer History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer#History)",
